 <h1>Maranda's Webpage</h1>
 <p>Welcome to my webpage. I am a junior at The College at Brockport.<p>
 <h2>My Major</h2>
 <p>I am studying Journalism and Broadcasting with a concentration in Public Relations. I picked up a minor in English recently as well.
 I was scared to get into the field of journalsim since it is a lot of writing, but I love it so much! Picking up English as a minor helped a lot
 .</p>
 <h2>My interests</h2>
 <p>Some interests I have are fashion and makeup. I always watch fashion and makeup vlogs before I go to bed. I want to go into Public Realtions
 for a company in the fashion or makeup industry. Mixing my passion with my job would be everything I would ever want.</p>
